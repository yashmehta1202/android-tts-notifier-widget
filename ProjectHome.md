Now available on the market.

Inspired by TTSNotifier on Xda-Developers (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=550839), this widget allows you to enable/disable voice notifications for incoming calls and sms'.

I use it primarily for while driving so I won't have to fumble around with the phone before deciding if I should pull over and answer, but I imagine it would be quite useful in other situations as well.

This requires Android 2.1+ and Text to Speech data to be installed.
